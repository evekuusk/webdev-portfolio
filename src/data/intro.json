  "ABOUT_PARAGRAPH": [
    "I am deeply smitten with puzzles and mysteries.  There is nothing I love more than getting lost in the flow of solving a challenging problem.",
    "In searching for a career that would fulfill that curiosity, I attended George Brown College for Jewellery Arts.  I found that fitting complex physical parts together was my favourite part of the creative process.  Later, and in a more abstract and impactful way than metalsmithing, I found that same joy in programming.",
    "Today, I am an unabashed optimist.  There is always something new to create and a better way to do it.  I am currently completing prerequisite courses to return to school to study computer science part-time in evening classes, and I am eager to find new professional challenges."
