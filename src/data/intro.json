  "ABOUT_PARAGRAPH": [
    "I grew up with an interest in art, design, and particularly visual storytelling.  After attending George Brown College for jewellery design & goldsmithing, I realized that while I did enjoy the process of refinements on a design, I felt more attune with the sense of flow from getting lost in a project and fitting pieces together.",
    "From here I considered alternate career options with more focus on finding that sense of getting lost in meticulous problem solving.  In a more abstract way than metalsmithing, I found it in programming.",
    "This brings us to today.  I am completing pre-requisite courses to return to school for computer science part-time in evening classes, and I am endlessly eager to learn more and meet new professional challenges."
